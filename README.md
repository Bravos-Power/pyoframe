A library to rapidly formulate large optimization models using Pandas or Polars dataframes.

## Acknowledgments

Martin Staadecker first created this library while working for [Bravos Energ√≠a](https://en.bravosenergia.com/). The library takes inspiration from Linopy and Pyomo, two prior libraries for optimization for which we are thankful.
