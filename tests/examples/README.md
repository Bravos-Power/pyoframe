# Examples

This directory contains three examples which also double as test cases.

- `diet_problem` is a simple example of a linear program using CSV input data.
- `facility_problem` is an example with mixed integer linear programming (MILP).
- `cutting_stock_problem` is a slightly more complex MILP example.

We plan to have a dedicated Examples section in our documentation.
