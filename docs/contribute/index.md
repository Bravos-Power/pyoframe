# Contribute

Contributions are more than welcome! Submit a pull request, or [open an issue](https://github.com/Bravos-Power/pyoframe/issues/new) and I (Martin) will gladly answer your questions on how to contribute.

## Setup a development environment

1. Clone this repository. `git clone https://github.com/Bravos-Power/pyoframe`

2. Install the dependencies. `pip install --editable .[dev,docs]`

3. Install the pre-commit hooks. `pre-commit install`

4. Run `pytest` to make sure everything is working. If not, [open an issue](https://github.com/Bravos-Power/pyoframe/issues/new)!

## Documentation

We use [Material Docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for documentation with several plugins to enable features like automatically compiling the docstrings into the reference API. Please **follow the [Google style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)** for docstrings.

## Helpful commands

- `pytest --cov`: Runs all the tests and generate coverage information.
- `mkdocs serve`: Generates the documentation locally. Navigate to [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/pyoframe/`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/pyoframe/) to check it out.
- `coverage html`: Generate a webpage to view the coverage information generated by pytest.

## Details for repository maintainers

### Expired Gurobi License

We use a Gurobi license to run our tests. If the tests fail an give a license expired error, generate a new one and copy the contents of the `guorbi.lic` file into the `GUROBI_WLS` Github secret (Settings -> Secrets and variables -> actions).
